# Tic Tac Toe Project Overview

Explore this Tic-Tac-Toe project, a strategic, interactive game designed for competitive players, offering a smart computer AI opponent with selectable difficulty levels. Built with functional design principles, this game is structured to evolve seamlessly from console-only to full DOM interactivity. Key functions include move analysis, strategic decision-making, and a flexible evaluation system for enhanced gameplay.

## Key Features

- Game Mechanics: Enables players to engage in turn-based Tic-Tac-Toe matches, with win/loss evaluation, tie conditions, and move history tracking through console.log.
- AI Opponent: A function-based AI that adapts to player actions with varied difficulty modes for balanced challenges.
- Move Evaluation System: Real-time move analysis to recognize potential winning moves and blocks, ensuring strategic gameplay.
- Difficulty Adjustments: Allows players to choose difficulty levels, affecting the computer’s strategic depth.
- Transition to UI: Structured for future UI expansion using modular DOM manipulation functions.
- Symbol Switching: Players switch between 'X' and 'O' each round, with 'X' always moving first, offering a fair start for both players.

## Constraints

- PvP functionality has not yet been implemented.
- The overall code could benefit from improved clarity and organization.
- The ability to change the user’s avatar has not been integrated yet.

## Additional Concepts Explored

- Utilization of closures within functions.
- Enhancing code efficiency by employing .querySelectorAll() followed by .classList.contains() to filter through DOM elements.
- Implementing delays for animations, announcements, and similar features using setTimeout().
- In-depth exploration of various array methods and proper chaining to determine the best options for both readability and maintaining code efficiency.
- Extended study of how to manipulate objects and access their properties with bracket notation.

## Applications Used

- Visual Studio Code
- Figma for future UI and UX designs
- Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Console and CodePen.io for prototyping and testing logic functions
